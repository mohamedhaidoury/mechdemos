         <h1>Static and Kinetic Friction Library</h1>
         <p>This demo library contains blocks that allow you to actuate a single joint primitive at a time with these types of friction:</p>
         <div>
            <ul>
               <li>A mix of static and kinetic contact friction, proportional to static and kinetic friction coefficients and the force normal
                  to the contact surface
               </li>
               <li>Kinetic damping friction proportional to joint primitive velocity, either translational or rotational, but with opposite sign</li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <p>These demo library blocks are masked subsystems containing SimMechanics and Simulink blocks.</p>
         <p>The mixed static-kinetic friction block makes use of the Joint Stiction Actuator block from the SimMechanics Sensors &amp; Actuators
            Library.  If the connected joint primitive locks, that degree of freedom (DoF) is removed from the system.  SimMechanics tests
            for locking and unlocking conditions with algebraic loops (non-time-based simulation steps) that can decrease the accuracy
            of your simulation, particularly if you use a fixed-step solver.  Use such Joint Stiction Actuator blocks only if you need
            to lock and unlock jonits.
         </p>
         <p>The kinetic damping friction block is a force element that applies a continuous friction force or torque via joint actuation
            using joint motion measured by a joint sensor.
