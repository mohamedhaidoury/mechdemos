         <h1>Stewart Platform with Control Reference Trajectory</h1>
         <p>Stewart platform with predefined reference trajectory. A Stewart platform is a six-degree-of-freedom machine for precise positioning
            and orienting. It consists of a top plate connected to a fixed base through six parallel legs. By extending or shortening
            the legs and swiveling them on a set of universal joints, the plate's original six degrees of freedom are reproduced with
            greater stability and precision.
         </p>
         <p>The model is separated into a plant subsystem, the Stewart platform along with necessary actuators and sensors, and a controller
            subsystem that guides the platform through a predefined motion profile with actuation signals. The controller keeps the actual
            motion close to the reference motion via sensor-actuator feedback.
